## General Info
This project was a group project made by Group 3 for Blackhawk Technical College's 4th semester
"Design and Implementation Project" class. Our task was to make the student site 
of a website that has information on BTC's new flex courses. Group 2 was responsible for the
staff/faculty site.

The website is meant to be an information hub that has all information a student may want to
know in one place, rather than needing to look up information on the college's various different
websites. From the staff portal that Group 2 made, faculty/staff will be able to add information such
as upcoming events, class information, etc, and the student portal will pull these changes from the
database to display on the student hub.

This project is very much a work in progress. The instructors were not yet sure of the actual content
they wanted on the website. Our job was just to get the basics of the site completed, and the project
will be continued by future classes.

This project was a collaboration by:
