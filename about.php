                <h4>Flex Lab Attendance Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    We recognize that today’s students are busy and are pulled in several directions
                    throughout their day.  Therefore, we are implementing a Flex Lab opportunity.  This means:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Students will have the ability to attend class (during the designated lab times)
                            when they are able.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Students must turn in an assignment every two work days, at a minimum, to be considered active
                            in the course.  Note: Students should maintain a steady work pace and submit more than one
                            assignment in a two-day period to stay current.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Students must attend all scheduled/required class days that are listed in the schedule at the end
                            of their syllabus.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All labs that require a student to use various equipment must be done in the IT Programs Lab using
                            the lab equipment.  It is the student’s responsibility to ensure they have enough time to
                            complete their labs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Students will be contacted if they have not submitted an assignment, been in the lab, or
                            contacted the instructor ahead of time in a one-week period.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Students who do not consistently meet the expectations (turning in assignments and regularly attend
                            lab times) for the Flex Lab format will be asked to attend class on a regular basis or ultimately
                            face withdrawal from the course and/or program.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Note: Not all courses are considered Flex Lab, and some may have dates that the student is required to attend.  Pay attention to the course syllabus, Blackhawk Technical College email, and Blackboard Announcements for this information.
                </p>
                <h4>Program Format</h4>
                <p>
                    The IT Programs consist of four programs that include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Computer Service Technician (CST) program is a one-year technical diploma program
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Manufacturing Information Technology Specialist (MITS) program is a two-year technical diploma program
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            IT-Network Specialist program is a two-year associate degree program
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            IT-Web Software Developer is a two-year associate degree program
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The format for all these programs is flexible lab using Internet, textbook, hands-on lab and assessment,
                    and instructor interaction as the primary learning components.
                    <br><br>
                    There is a lot of homework in these programs, especially reading.  Our suggestion is that you follow the
                    schedule in the syllabus to keep moving forward.  When in class you should be working with your
                    instructor to clarify anything that you need to.  Sometimes you can re-read something ten times and not
                    get it, but ten seconds with your instructor will make it crystal clear.  Please do not hesitate to ask for help.
                    <br><br>
                    Keep in mind that we want you to get used to encountering new, ever-changing material.  Sometimes you may have
                    to answer a question that is not found in your reading.  What will you do?  Where will you go to find the
                    answer you need?  We like you to encounter these real-world situations where the answer is not always
                    handed to you, where you have to do some sleuthing to get the solution to your problem.
                    When you leave the classroom, we want you to be ready to work, not afraid of what you're getting yourself into.
                </p>
                <h4>Designated Seating and Equipment</h4>
                <p>
                    Seating within the IT Programs labs is first come, first serve.  The only exception to this rule is areas
                    that are designated for specific purposes.  Please see an instructor if you have any questions.
                </p>
                <h4>Acceptable Work Within the IT Labs</h4>
                <p>
                    The work requirements for the programs within the IT Programs is abundant and can often be overwhelming.
                    To help students stay on track with their core IT courses and ensure that we have enough available seating for
                    students, we ask that students do not work on their non-IT related courses within the two IT Programs labs.
                    This work can be done, however, in the IT Programs soft classroom (lounge) areas.
                </p>
                <h4>Demonstrates Professional Behavior</h4>
                <p>
                    Employers expect their employees to demonstrate personal self-control and professional ethical behavior.
                    Disruption of the learning process by a student demonstrates a lack of self-control and professionalism.
                    Disruptive behavior (defined by the student handbook and or identified by the instructor) by a student that
                    interrupts the educational process in the classroom\lab, will result in a failing grade and will not be allowed
                    back into the class.
                    <br><br>
                    Arriving daily prepared for class develops productive work habits.  Employers expect their employees to have
                    the necessary equipment required to perform their assigned tasks.  Therefore, textbooks and supplies will be
                    <strong>required equipment</strong> needed daily to perform the assigned tasks and become a productive
                    participant in the program.  Repeatedly failing to attend class daily, without the required supplies and
                    textbooks could result in a failing grade, and the student will not be allowed back into the class.
                </p>
                <h4>Dress Code</h4>
                <p>
                    It is imperative that an employee dress for the job that they hold.  That is why students will be
                    <strong>required</strong> to wear, at a minimum, blue jeans and their program jacket.  Items that will not
                    be accepted are lounge pants, clothes with stains or holes, and any shirts that could be deemed offensive
                    by another student or staff member.
                </p>
                <h4>Cell Phones</h4>
                <p>
                    As part of professional work behaviors in this class there will be no use of social media (such as Facebook),
                    or of personal email, or cell phones in the classroom, lab or clinical site.  All cell phones and other such
                    devices will be turned off during class time.  Taking calls, texting, or reading messages, or taking photos or
                    recordings is prohibited during the class period.  Cell phone or electronic devices are not to be on your person
                    when at a clinical location.  Disregard for these guidelines will result in disciplinary action, up to, and
                    including expulsion from the class.
                </p>
                <h4>Spelling and Grammar</h4>
                <p>
                    Usually, a person is often judged by many different characteristics, but unfortunately many times in the
                    technology world technicians are never seen.  Much of the time their communications with customers, co-workers,
                    and administrators are in notes, memos, and emails.  That is why spelling and grammar are an important aspect of
                    the IT Programs.  The instructors will grade your work with this thought in mind.  You, the student, will be
                    docked 2.5 points for every five spelling and grammar mistakes that are found.  You will not be penalized more
                    than five (5) points for spelling and grammar mistakes on your Practice Projects and Assessment Tasks, and
                    twenty-five (25) points on your Capstone Exams.  Do not count on the spell checker to catch everything.
                    Take your time and proofread everything before you turn it in.
                </p>
                <h4>Food and Drink</h4>
                <p>
                    We do not approve of food in the lab.  Drinks are OK so long as they are in spill-proof containers.  Please do
                    not make the instructor be "the bad guy" for reminding you of this rule.  It may result in a
                    "no drinks in the lab" policy.
                </p>
                <h4>Games, Music, and Chats</h4>
                <p>
                    Increasingly, students in IT fields like to multi-task--read, play a game, use social media, and listen to
                    music.  It is fine to do all of these things in moderation.  However, we have had many students who end up
                    failing classes because they cannot control themselves and end up gaming or chatting their lab time away.
                    We are not your parents, but if we see you are starting to fall behind, we will get on your case.  Games
                    are not allowed unless you have specific approval from your instructor.  You will get one warning if you are
                    caught; after that, further violations will result in F grades.  In the case of music, you must use headphones.
                </p>
                <h4>Downloads</h4>
                <p>
                    Some students like to download music and programs to the IT Programs PCs.  It is your responsibility to make
                    sure you are doing this legally.  BTC and the IT Programs hold no responsibility for any illegal actions you may take.
